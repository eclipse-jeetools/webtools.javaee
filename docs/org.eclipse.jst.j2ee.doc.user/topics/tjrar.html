<h1 class="topictitle1">Creating a connector project</h1>
<div><div>A connector is a J2EE standard extension mechanism for containers
to provide connectivity to enterprise information systems (EISs).</div><div class="section"> <p> A connector is a J2EE standard extension mechanism for containers
to provide connectivity to enterprise information systems (EISs). A connector
is specific to an EIS and consists of a resource adapter and application development
tools. A resource adapter is a system-level software driver that is used by
an EJB container or an application client to connect to an EIS. Connectors
comply with the J2EE Connector architecture (JCA).</p>
<p>Like the other types
of projects, connector projects can contain one or more project facets, which
represent units of functionality in the project. A new application client
project should have the J2C Module facet. Depending on what you want to use
the project for, you may want to enable other facets for the project.</p>
<div class="restriction"><span class="restrictiontitle">Restriction:</span> J2EE 1.2 specification level does not include connector
capability.</div>
<p>To create a new connector project:</p>
</div>
<ol><li class="stepexpand"><span>In the J2EE perspective, select <span class="menucascade"><span class="uicontrol">File</span> &gt; <span class="uicontrol">New</span> &gt; <span class="uicontrol">Project</span> &gt; <span class="uicontrol">J2EE Enterprise
Applications</span> &gt; <span class="uicontrol">Connector Project</span></span>.</span></li>
<li class="stepexpand"><span>In the <span class="uicontrol">Project Name</span> field, type a name for
the connector project. </span></li>
<li class="stepexpand"><span>To change the default project location, clear the <span class="uicontrol">Use
default</span> check box under <span class="uicontrol">Project contents</span> and
select a new location with the <span class="uicontrol">Browse</span> button.</span> If you specify a non-default project location that is already being
used by another project, the project creation will fail.<div class="note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> If you type
a new EAR project name, the EAR project will be created in the default location
with the lowest compatible J2EE version based on the version of the project
being created. If you want to specify a different version or a different location
for the enterprise application, you must use the New Enterprise Application
Project wizard.</div>
</li>
<li class="stepexpand"><span>If you want to add the new project to an enterprise application
project, select the <span class="uicontrol">Add project to an EAR</span> check box
and select a project in the <span class="uicontrol">EAR Project Name</span> list.</span> If you choose to add the project to an existing EAR project, the <span class="uicontrol">Target
runtime</span> field becomes disabled because the target runtime for
the new project will be the same as that of the EAR project.</li>
<li class="stepexpand"><span>In the <span class="uicontrol">Target runtime</span> field, select the
target runtime for the project.</span></li>
<li class="stepexpand"><span>If you want to use a predefined configuration for your project,
select a configuration in the <span class="uicontrol">Common Configurations</span> list.</span></li>
<li class="stepexpand"><span>Click <span class="uicontrol">Next</span>.</span></li>
<li class="stepexpand"><span>Select the check boxes next to the facets you want this project
to have and select a version number for each facet. </span> You can also
choose a preset combination of facets from the <span class="uicontrol">Presets</span> list,
and you can find out more about the requirements for each facet by right-clicking
the facet name and then clicking <span class="uicontrol">Show Constraints</span>.</li>
<li class="stepexpand"><span>If you want to limit your project so it will be compatible with
one or more runtimes, click the <span class="uicontrol">Show Runtimes</span> button
and select the runtimes that you want the project to be compatible with.</span></li>
<li class="stepexpand"><span>Click <span class="uicontrol">Next</span>.</span></li>
<li class="stepexpand"><span>In the <span class="uicontrol">Source Folder</span> field, enter the name
of the folder to use for source code. </span></li>
<li class="stepexpand"><span>Click <span class="uicontrol">Finish</span>.</span></li>
